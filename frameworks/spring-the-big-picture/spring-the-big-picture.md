## What Is Spring?

### [Introduction](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=e8197f0f-d207-463f-aca4-7eeb975f30b2)

- Spring is one of the most popular technologies for Java development.

### [What Is Spring?](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=fdb7d227-f280-41f0-bf95-94f89a07e11b)

- 'Spring' can refer to a wide variety of technologies. Whens someone says 'Spring', they're likely referring to the family or ecosystem.

### [Meet the Spring Family](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=8f8afce6-cac6-49c8-bcd0-c26dcdd03546)

- Spring was built to reduce the complexity of working with J2EE (Java EE).
  - Make web development and data access easier.
  - Reduce boilerplate.
- A variety of project have been built on top of the Spring framework:
  - Spring Data
  - Spring Batch
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Social
  - Spring Kafka
  - Spring LDAP
  - Spring Web Services
  - Spring Session
  - Spring Integration
  - Spring Boot
    - Provided a new and faster way of building Spring-based applications.
    - Takes an opinionated view with sensible defaults, auto-configuration, simpler deployment.
  - Spring Cloud
    - Build on top of Spring Boot.
    - Simplified distributed architectures when using Spring.

### [Why Spring?](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=fecac44f-2a52-4fb0-ae76-375b23d7e1c0)

- Today, Spring is much more than just an alternative to Java EE. It's more complementary to Java EE than an alternative.
- Why Spring?
  - Because creating software can be hard. Spring can help make it easier.
    - Spring Framework Reference Documentation: "Spring makes it easier to create Java enterprise applications."
      - Shared theme across Spring projects.
  - Flexible, modular, backwards compatible.
    - Freedom to pick & choose.

## Getting to Know Spring with Spring Boot

### [Spring Boot Makes Spring Both Quick and Easy](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=8dcd8deb-e2ff-4822-ada1-b482355559cb)

- Spring Boot makes getting started with Spring quick & easy.
  - But without sacrificing features: It's fully-featured and heavily used in production environments.

### [Understanding Spring Boot's Key Features](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=5af675a4-d0ca-4327-b30f-7c36c7cbe1b4)

- Spring Boot can be used for both web- and non-web-based applications.
- Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework.
- Notable features
  - Auto-configuration
  - Standalone
  - Opinionated

### [Intelligent Auto-configurations](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=d97f2b1c-ad6c-4acc-aa79-c61dbaef76c8)

- A best-guess configuration, based on dependencies that have been added.
  - Contextual aware; smart
- Setting up auto-configuration:
  - `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation

### [Standalone Applications that "Just Run"](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=8132190b-3076-4630-989e-681617a4b6c3)

- "Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade, Spring-based applications that you can 'just run'."
  - Vs. typical Java web application:
    - Package application
    - Choose/download webserver
    - Configure webserver
    - Deploy application
    - Start webserver
- Spring Boot:
  - Package & run: `java -jar my-application.jar`

### [An Opinionated View of Spring](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=f9bed16b-4aca-43bb-aad4-4d59d98b618a)

- Building Java applications entails an overwhelming number of choices.
- Spring boot "favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible"
- Example:
  - Spring Initializer: [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
    - Create & download a fully-functional Spring Boot application based on dependencies
